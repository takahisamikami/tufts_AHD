# AHD attendance

## Tufts AHD attendance

### Goal
To understand if there is a specific rotation that always leads to joining late AHD. 

### Methods
- Attendance reports automatically generated by Zoom were used. 
- Periods: 11/4-12/2 (4 weeks; excluding 11/25 because there was no AHD)

### Limitation 
Not reflected in the data include: 
- Tufts consult residents log in but had to continue to work on notes or see pending consult (once)
- Lahey Jr had to go to stroke code just before 1pm
- Tufts Sr had to do family meeting (once)
- Lahey Sr had to do write notes while taking over the pager when Lahey Jr is seeing stroke codes (once)
